The fourth installment of the Terminator franchise, *Terminator 4 Salvation*, is set in the post-apocalyptic year of 2018, where humanity is fighting a war against the machines of Skynet. The film follows John Connor (Christian Bale), the leader of the resistance, as he tries to stop Skynet from launching a final attack that would wipe out the human race. Along the way, he encounters Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a mysterious stranger who claims to be a former death row inmate, but whose true identity is linked to Skynet's origins.

The film is directed by McG, who is best known for his work on the *Charlie's Angels* movies and the TV series *Supernatural*. The screenplay is written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who also wrote the previous film, *Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines*. The film features a star-studded cast that includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Helena Bonham Carter, Anton Yelchin, Moon Bloodgood, Common, and Michael Ironside.
 
The film received mixed reviews from critics and fans alike, who praised the action sequences and the visual effects, but criticized the plot, the characters, and the lack of emotional depth. The film was also compared unfavorably to the first two films of the series, directed by James Cameron, which are widely regarded as classics of the science fiction genre. The film was a moderate success at the box office, grossing over $370 million worldwide against a budget of $200 million.
 
The film is available on DVD and Blu-ray, with various editions and bonus features. The DVD version that I watched was a rip with Spanish subtitles in RMVB format, which is a compressed video format that reduces file size and maintains quality. The subtitles were clear and accurate, and did not interfere with the viewing experience. The video quality was decent, but not as sharp as a Blu-ray or HD version. The audio quality was good, with clear dialogue and sound effects.
 
Overall, I enjoyed watching *Terminator 4 Salvation*, as I am a fan of the franchise and I like action movies. However, I did not find it to be very memorable or satisfying as a sequel or a standalone film. It felt like it was missing something that made the first two films so great: a compelling story, engaging characters, and a sense of urgency and danger. It felt more like a generic sci-fi action movie than a true Terminator movie. I would recommend it to fans of the series who want to see more of the Terminator universe, but not to casual viewers who are looking for a high-quality sci-fi film.
  
One of the main issues that I had with the film was the characterization of John Connor. In the previous films, he was portrayed as a reluctant hero, a messiah figure, and a visionary leader. In this film, he seemed more like a stubborn rebel, a self-righteous zealot, and a reckless soldier. He did not seem to have much charisma or authority, and he often clashed with his superiors and his allies. He also did not have much chemistry with his wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), who was reduced to a minor role. I felt that Christian Bale did not capture the essence of John Connor, and that his performance was overshadowed by his infamous on-set rant.
 
Another issue that I had with the film was the introduction of Marcus Wright, who turned out to be a cyborg created by Skynet. I found his backstory to be confusing and implausible, and his motivations to be unclear and inconsistent. He claimed to have no memory of his past, but he also seemed to have some emotions and morals. He claimed to want to help John Connor and Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), but he also betrayed them to Skynet. He claimed to be human, but he also accepted his machine nature. I felt that Sam Worthington did a decent job of portraying Marcus, but that his character was poorly written and developed.
 
The film also had some plot holes and inconsistencies that bothered me. For example, how did Skynet know about John Connor's existence and importance, when in the previous films it only learned about him from the time-traveling Terminators? How did Skynet create a cyborg that could fool its own scanners and infiltrate its base? How did John Connor survive a nuclear blast and a heart transplant in the middle of a war zone? How did Kyle Reese become John Connor's father, when in this timeline he was captured by Skynet before meeting Sarah Connor? These are just some of the questions that I had while watching the film.
